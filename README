This is the RTEMS Scheduler Simulator.  It builds a subset of RTEMS in a
manner such that it can be used to develop, test, and evaluate scheduling
algorithms.

It takes many of the same arguments as RTEMS with one addition:

--enable-rtemsdir=DIRECTORY

where DIRECTORY is the top of the RTEMS source tree.

Other arguments are of interest are:

--enable-posix
--enable-smp
